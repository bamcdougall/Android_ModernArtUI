## Abstract

This GitHub Repository contains an Android Project built within Android Studio.  In addition to the Android Project (itself containing a plenitude of files and directories), this directory contains **4** primary files:

- **ReadMe.md** This file
- **ReadMe.txt** ReadMe.txt provides environment information for the build of this project
- **ModernArtUI.Rmd** ModernArtUI.Rmd is a file that generates the content of a Slidify presentation using the command author('ModernArtUI.Rmd').  The file can be revised using the command slidify('ModernArtUI.Rmd')
- **CodeBook.Rmd** CodeBook.Rmd contains definitions for the more variables of the Android Project

Use of **ModernArtUI.html** is a front-end user-facing file used for the gh-pages branch of the Repository.  The file is the Slidify presentation for this Android Project.  Press the link in the Description section of this Repository near the top of this page.
