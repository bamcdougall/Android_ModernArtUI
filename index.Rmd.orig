## Android Project - Modern Art UI

### App provides graphic interface for dedicated link to MOMA.org

### App uses "Overflow Menu" with Menu to "More Information"
* Provides user with options to open web browser that is linked to MOMA.org or cancel
* UI provides thumb slider that changes color of non-white / non-grey shapes
* Colors for transitions are randomly selected, but starting frame is recoverable
* Color transitions are controlled by ObjectAnimator.ofObject and started by the SeekBar
